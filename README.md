Phase-Fabric Rules

Welcome to Phase-Fabric, a tactical game of energy manipulation and explosive chain reactions. Place your pieces on the board to generate and channel energy, score points through harmonic resonance, and trigger devastating overloads to destroy your opponent's structures.

Objective

The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 500 points. The game can also end if the board becomes full, in which case the player with the higher score wins.

Game Pieces

Players take turns placing one of three types of pieces on an empty cell. Each piece has a unique function in manipulating the energy field.

● Anchor

Function: The fundamental source of energy.

Mechanics: An Anchor projects +1 energy to all 8 cells immediately surrounding it. Anchors are the only pieces that create a base energy field.

➤ Relay

Function: Amplifies and projects energy in a specific direction.

Mechanics:

A Relay has an "intake" side (the back) and a "projection" side (the front, indicated by the arrow).

It reads the total energy from Anchors only in its intake cell.

It adds +1 to this value and projects the new total forward in a straight line for 3 cells.

Important: Relays do not chain together; they only read energy generated by Anchors.

The energy projected by a Relay is credited to the Relay's owner.

Use the orientation buttons to change the direction a Relay will face before placing it.

◇ Prism

Function: Scores points by harmonizing energy fields.

Mechanics: A Prism generates points for its owner when the total energy in opposing adjacent cells is equal and greater than zero.

If the energy in the cell to the North equals the energy in the cell to the South (and is > 0), the Prism scores points equal to that energy value.

If the energy in the cell to the East equals the energy in the cell to the West (and is > 0), the Prism scores points equal to that energy value.

Both conditions can trigger in the same turn, scoring points for both axes.

Core Mechanics
Energy Fields

The board contains an invisible energy field, which is the sum of all energy projected by Anchors and Relays. The strength of this field in any given cell is what triggers Overloads and Prism scoring.

Overloads

Trigger: If the total energy from both players in a single cell reaches 5 or more, that cell becomes overloaded.

Resolution:

At the end of a turn, all overloaded cells "detonate" simultaneously.

Each detonation destroys all pieces (both friendly and enemy) in a 3x3 square centered on the overloaded cell.

If multiple 3x3 blast zones overlap, all pieces in the combined area are destroyed.

Scoring: The player who placed the piece that caused the overload scores points for every piece destroyed:

+1 point for each of their own pieces destroyed.

+2 points for each of their opponent's pieces destroyed.

Turn Sequence

Understanding the order of operations is key to mastering Phase-Fabric.

Placement: The current player places one piece (Anchor, Relay, or Prism) onto any empty cell.

Overload Phase: The game checks the entire board for any cells where the total energy is 5 or greater.

If overloads occur, the 3x3 blast zones are calculated, all affected pieces are removed, and the active player scores points.

Resonance Phase: After any overloads are resolved, the energy fields are re-calculated based on the remaining pieces.

All Prisms on the board are checked. If their scoring conditions are met, their owners are awarded points.

End of Turn: The turn passes to the other player. The game checks for win conditions.

Mastering Phase-Fabric requires anticipating how a single placement can alter the entire energy grid, setting up powerful Prism scores or triggering catastrophic, high-scoring overload chains. Good luck
